Our failing tests are important to the functioning of our board specifically. They include our test constants 
checking they are accurate to our board 26 rows and 26 columns. We needed to see the files are reading by checking the legend 
is reading properly all of the board symbols. Our rooms have very unique names so e.g. "City of Flickering Destruction" 
and "Gladiator Pit," so the legend.txt files is the same. Considering all of our initials for the rooms are custom 
we also needed to check the room initials are are in the correct board location. Many of our rooms are very odd shapes 
in it is important the columns and rows are accurate for the room labeling. e.g. The corner for room F is at (0,7) and for 
room L it is at (16,1). The doorways test also has some unique locations. The "Fox Room" has four doors so we wanted to 
test at least 2 of them, one facing left and one right. As well as "The Room Room" having four doors so we 
tested two doors each at the corners, one up and one down. It is important to see our corner doors are 
opening in the correct direction. We also have 18 doors so we need to test all of them are in the board.
